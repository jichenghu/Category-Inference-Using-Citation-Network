### Overview
This is a course project on graphical probability model. 
In this project, we will inference the catagories of computer science papers using their citaion networks. 
To test the performance of our algorithm, we will run it on datase [CORA](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA) and compare it to other approaches. 
Finally, we will commit our code and write a report in the form of a SIG conference paper. 
Hopefully, our work will be of help to you! Please enjoy!
