# Text Classification
In this section, we try to initially assign a label to each paper according to their title.
The approach we use here is Naive Bayes and it will be the baseline & base of our work.
* For the first step, we split the dataset into training set and test set.
* After that, we run the Naive Bayes and test its performance under different situations, that is, different percentage of the test set taking up the whole data.
